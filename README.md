# My First Data Science Project in Python
## This is the first data science project I made in python (Jupyter Notebook) in which I analyzed a Wikipedia article about attempted helicopter prison escapes in different countries

The Wikipedia article is this <a target="_blank" href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_helicopter_prison_escapes">list of helicopter prison escapes</a>.
We analyze the data of attempted helicopter prison escape and answer the following questions:
 - Of all the years recorded, which year had the most helicopter prison breaks?
 - Of all the countries recorded, which country had the most helicopter prison breaks?
 - Which escapee(s) have attempted a helicopter escape more than once?
 
I make use of a helper file from which functions are imported, and I make use of charts and tables to represent the results in a readable fashion and be able to draw conclusions and answers from them.

The analysis can be viewed in the DataAnalysis.ipynb file
